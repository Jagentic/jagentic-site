          <p>
            My WYZE and Ring cameras were installed for ordinary reasons: security, package monitoring,
            the usual precautions. Yet they have inadvertently made me an expert on my neighbors' lives.
            The technology timestamps every movement, creating an effortless chronicle of routines I never
            intended to study. I know work schedules, delivery patterns, the rhythm of the entire cul-de-sac—not
            through curiosity, but because the information is unavoidable.
          </p>

          <p>
            I practice deliberate restraint, choosing not to examine these patterns or dwell on what is
            technically visible. This self-policing is entirely voluntary, dependent on personal conscience
            alone. There are no guidelines, no shared understandings about where propriety begins or ends.
          </p>

          <p>
            This extends beyond cameras. I suspect I am surrounded by similar effects of which I am not
            even aware—smart home devices, location tracking, the network names broadcasting from every
            home. Many of us have become accidental voyeurs, our surveillance conducted in perfect silence
            with no apparent consequence. The only check is individual conscience.
          </p>

          <p>
            Perhaps more troubling: this feels too awkward to discuss, even within one's own household.
            We are isolated in silent silos of superpowers, each possessing our ready-to-serve super snooping
            platter while simultaneously being subject to someone else's perfect private indexing.
          </p>

          <p>
            Many of us are quietly navigating this ethical terrain, making individual decisions about restraint
            and respect. It would be interesting to know how others think about these boundaries, or whether
            they think about them at all.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>How do you navigate the gap between what your technology allows you to see and what feels
            appropriate to notice?</strong>
