# Jagentic Quiz Content Repository

This directory contains all quiz content for the Jagentic game show, organized into curated and compiled collections.

## Structure

```
content/
├── curated/          # AI-curated questions (timestamped daily)
├── compiled/         # Production-ready question packs
├── sources/          # Source material for curation
└── README.md         # This file
```

## Content Types

### Curated Questions (`curated/`)

Daily AI-curated quiz questions generated by the OpenAI SDK agent. Each file is timestamped and contains:

- **BIZ**: Technical questions about developer tools, productivity, APIs, coding
- **BUZZ**: Tech culture, personalities, trends, company news

Files are named: `curated-YYYY-MM-DD.json`

### Compiled Packs (`compiled/`)

Production quiz packs served to the game show:

- `pack.biz.json` - BIZ mode questions
- `pack.buzz.json` - BUZZ mode questions

Each pack contains up to 50 rotating questions, automatically updated by the curation agent.

### Source Material (`sources/`)

Repository for content you encounter through AI agent interactions. Add interesting facts, articles, and reference material here to inform future question generation.

## Curation Agent

The quiz curation agent runs daily via GitHub Actions:

- **Schedule**: 9 AM UTC (configurable in `.github/workflows/curate-quiz.yml`)
- **Engine**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
- **Input**: Recent tech news + curated sources
- **Output**: Fresh questions saved to `curated/` and `compiled/`

### Running Locally

```bash
# Set your OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run curation
npm run curate
```

### Manual Trigger

You can manually trigger the curation workflow:
1. Go to GitHub Actions
2. Select "Curate quiz questions daily"
3. Click "Run workflow"

## Adding Source Material

To continuously feed the agent with your AI-encountered content:

1. Create JSON files in `sources/` with this structure:
```json
{
  "topic": "AI Development Trends",
  "date": "2025-10-21",
  "items": [
    {
      "fact": "Description of interesting fact or trend",
      "source": "URL or reference",
      "category": "biz|buzz",
      "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"]
    }
  ]
}
```

2. The agent will use these sources when generating questions
3. Organize by topic or date - the structure is flexible

## Question Format

All questions follow this schema:

```json
{
  "id": "unique-id",
  "type": "mcq",
  "category": "biz|buzz",
  "difficulty": "easy|medium|hard",
  "question": "Question text?",
  "choices": ["Choice A", "Choice B", "Choice C", "Choice D"],
  "answer_index": 0,
  "explain": "Brief explanation of the correct answer",
  "source": "https://optional-source-url.com",
  "tags": ["topic", "subtopic"]
}
```

## Maintenance

- Curated files are kept indefinitely for historical reference
- Compiled packs maintain the most recent 50 questions per category
- Review `content/curated/` monthly to assess question quality
- Update source material in `sources/` as you discover new content

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Multiple daily runs for higher traffic
- [ ] Difficulty balancing based on player performance
- [ ] Community-submitted questions
- [ ] Integration with additional AI models
- [ ] Question performance analytics
